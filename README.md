# streams
I built this app as a part of my React course.

Features:

•	A CRUD, Single Page App built using React Redux, React Router and Redux Form
•	User login system using Google API and OAuth authentication flow
•	Every user can create unlimited channels/streams that they can stream to
•	The streamer software (such as OBS) streams a video to an RTMP server
•	Using Node-Media-Server as an RTMP server for receiving and broadcasting video streams
•	RESTful API server (JSON Server) for storing existing streams
